# Katashiro (紙代 / 形代) - OpenAB Companion ⛩️

**Katashiro (紙代 / 形代)** is a sleek Chrome Extension Side Panel companion designed for **OpenAB (Open Agent Broker)**. It connects via WebSockets using the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) to provide a premium, LINE-style single chatroom interface for real-time two-way communication with multiple AI agents, each connected over its own ACP endpoint.

## 🔮 The Metaphor of Katashiro (形代 / 紙代)

In Japanese Onmyodo (陰陽道) and Shinto rituals, a **Katashiro (形代 / 紙代)** is a physical paper doll or vessel used to temporarily host spirits or represent individuals. 

Under this system:
* **The Chrome Extension UI (Side Panel) = Katashiro (紙代)**
  * The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the physical vessel—an empty shell waiting in the browser.
* **The OpenAB AI Agents = Shikigami (式神)**
  * The spiritual intelligence and agent logic that is "summoned" and "injected" into the vessel over the WebSocket connection.
* **Writing the Code = Drawing Talismans**
  * Writing configuration files (`manifest.json`) and styling components acts as the ritual of drawing magical talismans to establish a connection path between the summoner and the spirit.
* **Browser Tools = The Shikigami's Hands (施術)**
  * Through **MCP-over-ACP**, the summoned agent no longer merely *speaks* through the vessel — it *acts*. The extension serves DOM-semantic tools (`click`, `read_dom`, `navigate`, `type`, `screenshot`) so the shikigami can reach through the katashiro and operate the living page. Perception and action, not just a voice.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Browser Control (MCP-over-ACP)**: the extension is an MCP server over the same `/acp` socket; the agent discovers and calls DOM-semantic browser tools (`click` / `read_dom` / `navigate` / `type` / `screenshot`) that execute in the active tab via `chrome.scripting`. See [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

- **Unified Chat Space**: Optimized specifically for a single multi-party chatroom, bypassing cluttered sidebar lists to fit perfectly in a narrow Side Panel.
- **LINE-style Chat Bubbles**: Self-sent messages align to the right (green), while received agent messages align to the left (dark slate blue) with custom avatars, sender names, and timestamp markers.
- **Connection Persistence**: Leverages the Chrome Side Panel API to host the WebSocket connection, allowing it to persist even as the user navigates across browser tabs.
- **Auto-Reconnection**: Automatically attempts to reconnect to the OpenAB broker every 5 seconds if the connection drops.
- **Premium Glassmorphic UI**: Features a modern dark-mode interface with glassmorphism styling, clean glow backdrops, and custom scrollbars for an enhanced visual experience.
